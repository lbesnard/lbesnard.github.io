## Hello, I'm Laurent

Welcome to my digital lab! I am a data scientist at the **University of Tasmania (UTAS)**, working closely with marine data and observations.

This blog is a space where I document my technical "wanders"—ranging from data science and oceanography to the general nerdery of building things.

### My Work & Affiliation

{{< affiliation >}}

I spend my time working with oceanographic datasets and contributing to the **Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)**.
Lately, I've mostly been focused on creating a [Python library](https://github.com/aodn/aodn_cloud_optimised) to convert all IMOS data into Cloud Optimised formats such as Zarr and Parquet.
